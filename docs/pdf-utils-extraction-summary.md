# PDF Utilities Extraction Summary

## Project Overview

We've created two scripts to extract the PDF utilities from the Gmail Invoice PDF
Collector project into a standalone repository:

1. `setup-node-repo.sh`: Generic script to set up a Node.js repository
2. `migrate-pdf-utils.sh`: Script to migrate PDF utilities code to the new repository

## Current Status

### Completed

- Created `setup-node-repo.sh` with:
  - GitHub workflows setup with CI on push, pull_request, and workflow_dispatch
  - Minimal Node.js project structure
  - Complete .gitignore with Node.js, IDE, OS, and secrets entries

- Created `migrate-pdf-utils.sh` with:
  - Code to copy PDF utilities from the source project
  - Test file migration with proper import path updates
  - Dependencies installation (pdf-lib, jest)
  - Test verification

### Next Steps

1. Import the pdf-utils repository into the workspace
2. Review the code organization
3. Update any imports in the original project to point to the new package
4. Run tests in both repositories to ensure functionality

## Minimalism Principles Applied

- Kept only essential files and directories
- Maintained GitHub workflows but kept them minimal
- Used a single comprehensive script for each task
- Focused exclusively on PDF utilities extraction without adding unnecessary files

## Repository Structure Created

```bash
pdf-utils/
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── ci.yml
├── src/
│   ├── pdf-utils.js
│   └── index.js
├── tests/
│   └── pdf-utils.test.js
├── README.md
├── package.json
└── .gitignore
```

## Migration Process

The migration process copies the essential PDF utilities files from the Gmail Invoice PDF 
Collector project, sets up the necessary structure, and verifies the functionality with 
tests.
