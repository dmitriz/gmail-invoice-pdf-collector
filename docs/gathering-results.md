# Gathering Results

This section defines how the effectiveness and completeness of the Gmail Invoice PDF Collector will be evaluated after implementation. The goal is to ensure that the system meets the original objectives with minimal manual intervention and clear measurable outputs.

## Success Criteria
- ✅ **Correctness**: All relevant invoice and receipt emails are correctly identified using the LLM.
- ✅ **Completeness**: All valid PDF attachments from those emails are successfully downloaded.
- ✅ **Consolidation**: A final merged PDF is generated containing all retrievable documents.
- ✅ **Resilience**: The system logs any skipped, malformed, or failed emails/PDFs without crashing.
- ✅ **Reusability**: The tool can be reused with minimal effort across accounts or use cases by changing configuration only.
- ✅ **Clarity**: Documentation clearly explains how to set up and run the system, both in mock and real mode.

## Validation Approach
- Use the **mock dataset** (emails and PDFs) to verify:
  - That only relevant emails are selected
  - That all attachments are handled as expected
- Run the **real mode** on a test Gmail account with known test emails and verify:
  - That the merged PDF includes exactly the expected number of valid files
  - That invalid or missing PDFs are logged, not silently dropped

## Post-Delivery Considerations
- Optionally compare LLM predictions against human-labeled results for future accuracy improvement.
- Monitor LLM API limits and adapt to more scalable models if needed.
- Evaluate adding summary page or index to merged PDF in future phases (if requested).
