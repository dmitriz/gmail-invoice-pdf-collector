# GitHub Copilot Repository Instructions

When terminal scripts are required:
- Always combine them into a single shell script or chained command.
- Avoid prompting multiple times for individual commands.
- Plan ahead and try to combine all scripts you will need down the road and request approval only once for the full batch.

- Avoid redundant or conflicting ESLint configs. Stick to one, preferably `.eslintrc.json`, or none at all.
